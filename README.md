A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game using if, elif and else statements. I also used a random generator to import random numbers for the computer

This Python script is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" played between a player and the computer. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

Defines ASCII art representations of rock, paper, and scissors.
Imports the random module to allow the computer to make a random choice.
Stores the ASCII art representations of the game options in a list called games_images.
Prompts the player to input their choice (0 for rock, 1 for paper, 2 for scissors).
Checks if the player's input is valid and prints their chosen option.
Generates a random choice for the computer and prints its chosen option.
Determines the winner based on the choices made by the player and the computer.
Prints the result of the game (win, lose, or draw).
Here's a breakdown of the main parts of the script:

The player's choice is stored in the variable player_choice.
The computer's choice is generated using random.randint(0, 2) and stored in the variable computer_choice.
The script then compares the choices made by the player and the computer to determine the winner.
If the player wins, it prints "You Win!".
If the player loses, it prints "You lose!".
If it's a draw, it prints "It's a draw!".
Overall, this script provides a simple and interactive way to play the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer.
